# mnist-neural-network-digit-recognition
Trains a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits with the mnist dataset

To run the code, please include the neural network library from this repo:

https://github.com/Singalt16/neural-network-library

And the MNIST handwritten digit dataset:

http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Place the uncompressed data files in a folder and replace the path in the following line in main.py with the path to your folder
```python
mnist_data = MNIST("MNIST_dataset_uncompressed")
```
